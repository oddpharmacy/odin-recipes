        <h3>Scrumptious buttery goodness</h3>
        <p>The best cake to go with tea, and quite literally everthing else. Recipe from <a href="rasamalaysia.com/recipe-butter-cake/">rasamalaysia</a>.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>All purpose flour</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Yogurt or Milk</li>
            <li>Baking powder</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Lightly grease the pan (loaf pan, mini loaf pan, 8x8-inch or 9x9-inch square pan, round pan) with some butter. Mix the flour and the baking powder together and sieve. Add in the salt and mix well. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Use an electronic hand mixer or stand mixer to beat the butter and sugar until well combined or pale yellow in color, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add in the first egg. Beat well after each addition of egg until creamy, about 1 to 2 minutes after adding each egg.</li>
            <li>Scrape down the sides for even mixing. Add in the vanilla extract and mix well. Fold in the flour and mix well. Add in the plain yogurt or whole milk.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the greased baking pan. Shake it lightly to distribute the cake batter evenly. Bake until golden brown and cooked, about 40 - 50 minutes. To prevent the top of the cake from over browning, cover the top of the baking pan with a sheet of aluminum foil once the cake top is set. Use a cake tester to test doneness.</li>
            <li>Remove it from the oven and let cool on the wire rack for 5 minutes. Cut into pieces and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
